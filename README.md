# Les Miserables Character Network Data

This folder contains a single data file ("jean-complete.dat") which represents an update to the network of characters in Victor Hugo's Les Miserables first encoded by Professor Donald Knuth, as part of the Stanford Graph Base (SGB) as file "jean.dat"

Although the work of Professor Knuth was extensive, capturing much of the complexity of the characters and their interactions within the novel, it did not capture all of the data. And, whilethe original "jean.dat" file authored by Professor Knuth remains frozen as a permanent example and reference for computer scientists to evaluate different grouping algorithms, Humanists studying the novel would benefit from a corrected and fully-realized dataset.

Northwestern Professor Michal Peled Ginsburg, a scholar of the novel, has devoted considerable time and effort, with the help of the Weinberg College of Arts and Sciences Multimedia Learning Center to correct and expand Knuth's original work so that the original dataset might better serve literary scholars and computer scientists alike.
