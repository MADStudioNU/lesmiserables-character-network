# Les Miserables Character Network Data

This folder contains a data file ("jean-complete.dat") which represents an update to the network of characters in Victor Hugo's Les Miserables first encoded by Professor Donald Knuth, as part of the Stanford Graph Base (SGB) as file "jean.dat"

Although the work of Professor Knuth was extensive, exposing some of the notable complexity of the characters and their interactions within the novel, it did not capture all of the data. The original "jean.dat" file authored by Professor Knuth remains permanently frozen as a consistent example and reference for computer scientists to evaluate different grouping algorithms. Through the years, several visualizations and analyses have been constructed from this original, fixed data. Scholars of the novel risk, however, being misled by such visualizations which might not fully or most accurately portray the complete set of characters and their interactions. Therefore, humanists and enthusiasts studying the novel should benefit from a corrected and more fully-realized dataset.

To this end, Professor Michal Peled Ginsburg, of the Department of French and Italian at Northwestern University, has devoted considerable time and effort, with the help of the WCAS Multimedia Learning Center to correct and expand Knuth's original work so that the original dataset might better serve literary scholars and computer scientists alike.

For reference, the original Stanford Graph Base file ("jean.dat") is also included in this repository.
