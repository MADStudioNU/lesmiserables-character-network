# Les Miserables Character Network Data

This folder contains a data file ("jean-complete.dat") which represents an update to the network of characters in Victor Hugo's Les Miserables first encoded by Professor Donald Knuth, as part of the Stanford Graph Base (SGB) as file "jean.dat"

Although the work of Professor Knuth was extensive, exposing some of the notable complexity of the characters and their interactions within the novel, it did not capture all of the data. And, while the original "jean.dat" file authored by Professor Knuth remains permanently frozen as a consistent example and reference for computer scientists to evaluate different grouping algorithms, Humanists studying the novel can benefit from a corrected and fully-realized dataset.

Northwestern Professor Michal Peled Ginsburg, a scholar of the novel, has devoted considerable time and effort, with the help of the  Multimedia Learning Center of Weinberg College of Arts and Sciences to correct and expand Knuth's original work so that the original dataset might better serve literary scholars and computer scientists alike.

The new version of the data file ("jean-complete.dat") has been authored by Michal Peled Ginsburg, starting from the original work of Donald P. Knuth.

For the sake of comparison, the original Stanford Graph Base file ("jean.dat") is also included in this repository.
