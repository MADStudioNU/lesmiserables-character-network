# Les Miserables Character Network Data

This folder contains a data file ("jean-complete.dat") which represents an update to the network of characters in Victor Hugo's Les Miserables first encoded by Professor Donald Knuth, as part of the Stanford Graph Base (SGB) as file "jean.dat"

Although the work of Professor Knuth was extensive, exposing some of the notable complexity of the characters and their interactions within the novel, it did not capture all of the data. The original "jean.dat" file authored by Professor Knuth has remained (and must remain) permanently frozen in order to provide a consistent reference for computer scientists to evaluate different grouping algorithms. Through the years, several visualizations and analyses have been constructed from this original, fixed data. The fixed data set and any visualizations or analyses drawn from it but can only be understood to approximate the novel.

Scholars of the novel interpreting visualizations based on the original jean.dat risk being misled since they will not fully portray the complete set of characters and their interactions. Instead, humanists and enthusiasts studying the novel should have access to use a corrected and more fully-realized dataset.

To this end, Professor Michal Peled Ginsburg, of the Department of French and Italian at Northwestern University, has devoted considerable time and effort, with the help of the WCAS Multimedia Learning Center to correct and expand Knuth's original work so that the original dataset might better serve literary scholars and computer scientists alike.

For reference, the original Stanford Graph Base file ("jean.dat") is also included in this repository.
